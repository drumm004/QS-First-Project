## Overview
This project is a website designed for a budding entrepreneur who wants to move into an online space to showcase accomplishments and gallery creations, create a space for communicating with like-minded individuals and to launch a storefront in the future.

## Details
The website will be a bio with the ability to create connections via registration on the site with a form collecting user data. It will be linkable to something similar to a blog spot, a gallery and space, under construction, saved for selling merchandise at some future date.
